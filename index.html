          <h5> Introduction</h5>
          <p>Welcome to my beginners guide to Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel links! I've been playing this game since the release date it was launched. The reason why I started playing Duel links is because to me I felt a lot of nostalgia when getting into it. But don't feel as if this game isn't for you because you never watched the anime or played the actual card game in the past. I introduced the card game to most of my friends and they had enjoyed the experience and are still playing till this day. If anyone would like to add me as a friend on Duel Links my Duelist ID is "280-996-532". </p>

          <h5> Overview</h5>
          <p>This will be a guide to get you started in the game. Before you go spending your hard earned cash on this game, I have few tips for you to be succesful in Duel links without spending a dime. To start off, I beleive that everyone should focus on one meta pvp deck. This is because there are limit amount of gems you get to begin with and all meta pvp decks are gem costly. So the first step would be focusing on one deck and afterwards work on others. This is because having a meta pvp deck will be so uselful progressing through Duel World and PVP. Faster progression means more gems to collect. I have gathered information of three current meta decks. Below are the characters that you use to accompany with your deck. Whichever character you choose, I will have all the information you need to know on how to use the deck, what cards you need, and how to obtain the cards. There will also be a gem farming guide to help you complete the decks.</p>
